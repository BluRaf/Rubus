Rubus is launcher for Minecraft: Pi Edition (Minecraft Pocket Edition port for Raspberry Pi computer).
Actually it doesn't support any modding API, but I think this will change ASAP :)

Requirements
------------
- Python 3.x
- Working internet connection :)

How to run launcher?
--------------------
Use this oneliner for install latest version from git:
